# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains code for two machine learning projects: Framingham Heart Disease Prediction and MNIST Digit Recognition.

## Framingham Heart Disease Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from the Framingham Heart Study. A logistic regression model is employed to classify individuals based on various health indicators.

### Dataset
The analysis utilizes the `framingham.csv` dataset, which comprises medical information for a cohort of individuals. The primary objective is to predict the `TenYearCHD` variable, a binary indicator representing the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease within a decade.

## MNIST Digit Recognition
This project demonstrates a basic digit recognition model using a logistic regression classifier on the MNIST dataset.
